			blockquote.testimonial Nick can do and he can teach. This means he makes everyone around him better at their job, and he’s always pursuing mastery so he can turn around and help others. I definitely would not have had many of the successes I did at the company without him. If I could, I’d have Nick on my team everywhere I worked!
