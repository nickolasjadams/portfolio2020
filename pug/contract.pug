	h2 Design

	p I've won awards in Graphic Design and Web Development. I consistantly created top-selling web design templates during my time at HomeCU.

	p I've built fantastic websites when provided an amazing design and graphics. One of my favorite designs I've ever worked on came from #[a(href="https://www.curiousmedia.com/" target="_blank") Curious Media]</a>.

	#accordion
		.card
			.card-header#headingOne
				h3.mb-0
					button.btn.btn-link(data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapseOne" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseOne") 
						| The Results of Being Handed A Fantastic Design

			#collapseOne.collapse(aria-labelledby="headingOne" data-parent="#accordion")
				.card-body.row
					.col-12.col-sm-6
						p When HomeCU was sold and the software developers were laid off, I found myself interviewing at Curious Media. The interview process was lengthy, but all seemed to be going great. 
						p They asked me to prove myself by creating a complex landing page for a previous design they had built. That was quite a big test for an interview, but they offered to pay me for it.
						p I accepted since it was an old design, and they sent me the assets.
						p It was the promotional website for The 2017 Captain Underpants movie by DreamWorks! 
						p I worked on it when I wasn't interviewing at other places. A few days later I had it nearly complete, but was offered and accepted another job. 
						p I had a blast and added some animation for fun.
						p Here are the results!

	h2 Accessibility

	p I've helped hundreds of Credit Unions overhaul the accessibility of their websites during a flood of ADA lawsuits in 2017 and 2018. <a href="https://www.cutimes.com/2020/08/24/why-ada-compliance-is-important-at-your-credit-union/?slreturn=20220409002952" target="_blank">Read about why ADA compliance is important for Credit Unions and the rest of the internet</a>.

	h2 Programming

	p Created and hosted customized solutions for Custom Content Management Systems.

	p Repaired and improved the current Search Engine Crawler system that powers the <a href="https://idaho.gov/search" target="_blank">Idaho.gov Search Engine</a>, and continue to improve the search engine UI and Analytics reports.
	
	// dropdown that talks about the progressive crawl cycle schedule and internal tools

	p Worked on new features and improvements to multiple Idaho State applications including <a href="https://www.accessidaho.org/account/" target="_blank">Access Idaho's My Account</a> web application, the <a href="https://www.accessidaho.org/itd/aero/" target="_blank">Idaho Transportation Department Aeronautics</a> web application, the <a href="https://www.accessidaho.org/itd/driver/" target="_blank">Idaho Transportation Department DMV</a> web application.

	p Currently working on multiple personal Laravel projects.
